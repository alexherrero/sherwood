description: Turn a brief into .harness/PLAN.md with per-task verification criteria. No code written.
argument-hint: <brief — what to build or change>
---

You are running the **plan** phase of the agentic-harness workflow. The full spec is at `harness/phases/02-plan.md` in the harness repo (also copied to this project's `.harness/phases/02-plan.md` if present). Read that spec and follow it.

**Brief from the user:** $ARGUMENTS

**Non-negotiable constraints for this phase:**
1. Do not write any application code. Implementation is the `/work` phase.
2. Read `.harness/PLAN.md` and `.harness/progress.md` first. If a plan is in flight, ask before replacing it.
3. Interview the user (≤5 batched questions) only if the brief is ambiguous. Skip if the brief is clear.
4. Write the plan to `.harness/PLAN.md` using the structure from `templates/PLAN.md`.
5. Update `.harness/features.json` if this plan introduces user-visible features.
6. Append a single line to `.harness/progress.md`.
7. End with a ≤5-bullet summary to the user. Next command to run is `/work`.

Start by reading the relevant state files and the full phase spec.
