#!/usr/bin/env bash
# verify.sh — per-project verification hook.
# Called by the Claude Code PostToolUse hook after every Write|Edit with the
# path of the file that was just written or edited as $1.
#
# Customize the case statement below to match your project's typecheck/lint.
# Leave commands commented until you know you want them — a noisy hook is
# worse than no hook.
#
# RULES:
# - This runs on EVERY Write/Edit. Keep it FAST (<2s total). Full-suite tests
#   belong in /review or CI, not here.
# - Prefer single-file operations (lint one file, not the whole project).
# - Exit 0 on success (silent), non-zero on failure (shown as system message).
# - Stdout/stderr are shown to the user, so keep output minimal on success.
