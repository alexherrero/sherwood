# AGENTS.md

Universal instructions for AI coding agents working in a project using `agentic-harness`. Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, and other tools that read `AGENTS.md` should use this as the entry point. Claude Code users should also read this file (it's linked from `CLAUDE.md`).

## What this harness is

A phase-gated workflow with on-disk state. You are expected to execute exactly one phase per session, not freestyle across the full development lifecycle in one go.

## Phases (hard boundaries)

1. **Setup** — first-time scaffold, feature list, `init.sh`. Run once per project.
2. **Plan** — turn a brief into `.harness/PLAN.md` with tasks and verification criteria. No code written.
3. **Work** — pick one task from the plan, implement it, update `progress.md`. Stop.
4. **Review** — adversarial critique. Assume the code has bugs. Produce a failing test or a specific line-number defect — not prose.
5. **Release** — pre-merge gate. Clean tree, all verification passes, changelog updated.
6. **Bugfix** — a different pipeline: Report → Analyze → Fix → Verify. Used instead of Plan+Work for bugs.

Each phase has a canonical spec in [`harness/phases/`](harness/phases/). Tool-specific adapters (slash commands for Claude Code, equivalent entrypoints for Antigravity) point back to those canonical specs.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Read `.harness/PLAN.md` before doing anything in `/work` or `/review`.** If it doesn't exist, you're in the wrong phase — stop and run `/plan` first.
2. **Single task per `/work` session.** Do not implement multiple tasks "while you're in there." The plan exists to sequence work; respect the sequence.
3. **Verification must be executable.** LLM-judge "looks good to me" is not verification. Deterministic checks (typecheck, lint, tests, build) come first; LLM review augments, never replaces.
4. **State is on disk, not in this conversation.** Write progress to `.harness/progress.md` at the end of every phase. The next session won't have your context.
5. **Do not delete or edit tests to make them pass.** If a test is wrong, surface it and stop for human input.
6. **Sub-agents are for read-only fan-out**, not parallel implementation. Dispatch them to gather context; never to edit code.

## How to invoke phases

- **Claude Code:** `/plan <brief>`, `/work`, `/review`, `/release`, `/bugfix <report>`.
- **Antigravity / tools without slash commands:** prompt the agent with "Run the plan phase per AGENTS.md" (or work / review / etc.). The agent should read [`harness/phases/`](harness/phases/) and follow the spec.

## Core principles (why the harness looks like this)

See [harness/principles.md](harness/principles.md) for the full reasoning. Short version:

- Context is ephemeral, files are durable.
- Coherence-critical work (coding) should be single-threaded; read-only breadth can fan out.
- Deterministic verification is cheap and truthful; LLM judgment is expensive and sycophantic.
- Adversarial review only finds bugs if the reviewer is primed to assume bugs exist.
- Re-audit the harness whenever the underlying model ships a new version — scaffolding decays.
