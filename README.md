# Sherwood 📈

A modular, proof-of-concept automated trading engine and management dashboard. This project provides a foundation for executing algorithmic trades, performing regression testing against historical data, and managing bot configurations via a React-based web interface.

## 🚀 Overview

`Sherwood` is designed for those who want a simple, basic trading bot without the complexities of scripts or code. It covers all the basics, historical data and modeling for stocks and crypto, basic trading plans / rules, backtesting and **paper trading (dry run)** or **Live** functionality.

## ⚠️ In Development

Sherwood is experimental. It is not expected to work nor should you consider it reliable for any purpose. Code here is intended to demonstrate the potential of AI-assisted software development and should not be used for any real-world trading. Use at your own risk.
